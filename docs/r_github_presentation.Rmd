# Why version control?

???

For straightforward coding project, there is a single person and two points: start and end. However, when the project increases in complexity, there can be other steps in the process, such as bug fixes, feature requests, and reverts (opps!). With many points in the development timeline, it can be really useful to have control over the versions along the development path and the development history overall.

???

There are a number of different software available to do version control. You might have heard of a few, most notable are Apache Subversion (SVN) and Git. Because R users have generally adopted Git (and GitHub) for package development, we will focus on Git today.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

How does it work?


???
Each tree node, commit and files has own unique 40 character long SHA-1 representation(We can say thatâ€™s the key). Thus those elements are added to a tree data structure which is persisted inside .git/objects folder.

Git handles content in snapshots, one for each commit, and knows how to apply or roll back the change sets between two snapshots.

# Glossary of terms

**Branch**: A named pointer to a specific snapshot.It notes the place where new changes should be applied to when this branch is used. When a change is applied to a branch, then also the branch label moves to the new commit.  
**Commit** (*verb and noun*): Create a snapshot and the name of the resulting snapshot.  
**Diff**:  
**Git**:  
**GitHub**:  
**Gitignore**:  
**History**:  
**Origin**:  
**Pull**:  
**Push**:  
**Revert**:  
**Shell**:  
**Snapshot**: A version created by the commit operation.
**SSA Key**:  
**Stage**:
