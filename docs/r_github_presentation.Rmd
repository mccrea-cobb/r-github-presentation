# Why version control?

???

For straightforward coding project, there is a single person and two points: start and end. However, when the project increases in complexity, there can be other steps in the process, such as bug fixes, feature requests, and reverts (opps!). With many points in the development timeline, it can be really useful to have control over the versions along the development path and the development history overall.

???

There are a number of different software available to do version control. You might have heard of a few, most notable are Apache Subversion (SVN) and Git. Because R users have generally adopted Git (and GitHub) for package development, we will focus on Git today.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

# How does it work?

.center[![:scale 75%](images/git_steps.png)]

???

1. Create some work locally in your working directory. 
2. **git add** adds these changes to the staging area. 
3. **git commit** commits these changes to the local repository on your computer (a folder). Each tree node, commit and files has own unique 40 character long SHA-1 representation(We can say thatâ€™s the key). Thus those elements are added to a tree data structure which is persisted inside .git/objects folder.
4. You can repeat this and even just continue to use local version control. 
5. **git push** pushes the changes that you committed to the remote repository. For the examples today, this would be a repository on GitHub. 
6. **git pull** updates the local repository with changes from the remote repository.


Git handles content in snapshots, one for each commit, and knows how to apply or roll back the change sets between two snapshots.

# Getting started

1. Download ([link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) and install (requires admin) **git** 
2. Create a **GitHub** user account ([link](https://github.com/join))
3. Create an **SSH key** in GitHub (*Settings/SSH and GPG keys/New SSH key*)
4. Ask to join the FWS GitHub organization ([@USFWS](https://github.com/USFWS))
5.

# Glossary of terms

**Branch** A named pointer to a specific snapshot. It notes the place where new changes should be applied to when this branch is used. When a change is applied to a branch, then also the branch label moves to the new commit.  
**Commit** (*verb and noun*): Create a snapshot and the name of the resulting snapshot.  
**Diff**: Shows the difference of between the working directory and the given branch.  
**Git**:  
**GitHub**: A website for hosting projects that use git.  
**Gitignore**:  
**History**:  
**Merge**:  Merges the given branch into the current branch.
**Origin**:  
**Pull**:  
**Push**: Updates remote branch and local copy of the remote branch. Allows you to create new branches in the remote repository.    
**Revert**:  Rolls back one or more patch sets on the working directory, then creates a new commit on the result.  
**Shell**:  
**Snapshot**: A version created by the commit operation.  
**SSA Key**:  
**Stage**:

# Demo

???

1. Creating a repository in GitHub
2. Creating an Rstudio project with version control
    a. Cloning a GitHub repository to a local repository.
    b. Creating an empty RStudio project/package, creating content, and pushing content to an empty GitHub repository.
3. Installing an R package from GitHub
