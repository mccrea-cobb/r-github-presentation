# Why do ~~vrsion~~ version control?

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;
1. Revert back to previous version of a file

2. Keep a history of changes made to your work

3. **Collaborate** on your work simultaneously while managing conflicts

For straightforward coding project, there is a single person and two points: start and end. However, when the project increases in complexity, there can be other steps in the process, such as bug fixes, feature requests, and reverts (opps!). With many points in the development timeline, it can be really useful to have control over the versions along the development path and the development history overall.

There are a number of different software available that can help with version control. You might have heard of a few, two of the most well-known are Apache Subversion (SVN) and Git. Because R users have generally adopted GitHub for package development, we will focus on Git today.

Git is a free open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

# How does it work?

.center[![:scale 75%](images/git_steps.png)]

???

1. First, you create some work locally in your project directory. 
2. If you want to start a version history of these edits, the first step is to "stage" the changes. The shell command is **git add**.
3. **git commit** commits these changes to the local repository on your computer (a folder). Each tree node, commit and files has own unique 40 character long SHA-1 representation(We can say thatâ€™s the key). Thus those elements are added to a tree data structure which is persisted inside .git/objects folder.
4. You can repeat this and even just continue to use local version control. 
5. **git push** pushes the changes that you committed to the remote repository. For the examples today, this would be a repository on GitHub. 
6. **git pull** updates the local repository with changes from the remote repository.


Git handles content in snapshots, one for each commit, and knows how to apply or roll back the change sets between two snapshots.

# Initial setup

- Install **git** (requires FWS admin). 
    + Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win

- Tell git your name and email address (the one from GitHub).
    + In the shell (*"Tools/Shell..." from new RStudio session*), run:

```{}
git config --global user.name "your-full-name"
git config --global user.email "your-email-address"
```

.pull-left[
- In **RStudio**, navigate to "*Tools/Global Options/Git/SVN*" and:  
    + Check the box for "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects".
    + Direct RStudio to your git executable file (git.exe). The default location is: "*C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe*".
    + Create an SSH/RSA key.

# Initial setup (cont.)

- In **GitHub**:
    + [Create a GitHub user account](https://github.com/join).
    + Join the FWS GitHub organization ([@USFWS](https://github.com/USFWS)).
    + [Add the SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) that you created in RStudio to your GitHub account ("*Settings/SSH and GBG keys/New SSH key*"). You only need to do this once.
  + Create a GitHub repository in the USFWS Github organization by contacting an  [owner](https://github.com/orgs/USFWS/people?query=role%3Aowner).

# Create a New Version Control RStudio Project

.pull-left[
- Create a GitHub repository, if you've not already.

- Create a new RStudio Project. 
    + Chose *Version Control* and *Git*. 
    + Enter your repository's URL. **Note that this is password-protected SSH URL (_NOT THE HTTP URL!_)**. For example *git@github.com:your-user-name/your-repo.git*. 
    + Name the project and assign a directory. 

- Make local changes and save them.

# Create a New Version Control RStudio Project

.pull-left[
* In RStudio
    + Navigate to the *Git* tab and check the boxes next the files and folders that you want included. 
    + Select *Commit*. 
    + Add a commit message.
    + Click *Commit* and then *Push*. 
        
- In GitHub:
    * Confirm that your changes were pushed to your GitHub repository.

# Add Version Control to an RStudio Project

.pull-left[
- Create a GitHub repository

- Open an existing RStudio project. In **Tools/Project Options/Git/SVN**, update **Version Control System** from **(None)** to **Git**. Initialize a new git repository.

- Under the **Git** tab in Rstudio, check files that you want Git to ignore. This is genenally output files and your .Rproj file. 

- Uncheck your ignore files. Check all files that you want to stage. Click **Commit**.

- Add a commit message.

- Click **Commit**. You've created a local Git repository.

# Add Version Control to an RStudio Project

- To push your local Git repository to GitHub. In the shell, type:

```{}
git remote add origin git@github.com:user-name/repository-name.git
git push -u origin master
```

- In GitHub:
    * Confirm that your changes were pushed to your GitHub repository.

# Glossary of terms
 
**Branch**: A named pointer to a specific snapshot. It notes the place where new changes should be applied to when this branch is used. When a change is applied to a branch, then also the branch label moves to the new commit. 

**Commit** (*verb and noun*): To create a snapshot of your code at a specific time. The name of the resulting snapshot.  

**Diff**: The difference of between the working directory and the given branch.

**Fork**: A copy of the remote repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

**Git**: A free and open source distributed version control system.  

**GitHub**: A website for hosting projects that use Git.  

**Gitignore**: A file that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.  

**History**: A series of snapshots committed for a repository over time.

---
# Glossary of terms (cont.)

**Merge**: A command to integrate version histories from multiple branches into a single branch.  

**Origin**: The shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from.  

**Parent**: The prior commit. Initial commit don't have a parent and merges have two parents.  

**Pull**: A command used to upload local repository contents to a remote repository. This is how you transfer commits from your local repository to the remote repository.  

**Push**: A command used to update a remote branch and local copy of the remote branch. Allows you to create new branches in the remote repository. 

**Revert**: To roll back one or more patch sets on the working directory, then creates a new commit on the result.  

**Shell**: The software that lets you interact with the computer via command line.  

**Snapshot**: A version created by the commit operation.


---
# Glossary of terms (cont.)

**SHA (secure hash algorithm)**: A unique identifier for an individual commit. 

**SSA Key**: An access credential that is used in the Secure Shell network protocol used to encrypt remote communications between machines. 

**Stage**: To prepare a file for a commit.
