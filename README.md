# R and Git: An Introduction for FWS Biologist

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Abstract
Version control is a system to record and manage changes to files over time. Version control systems, such as Git, allow us to revert files and entire projects back to previous states, document and compare changes, and more effectively work as a team on projects. This presentation will introduce the basics of integrating Git and GitHub into your RStudio workflow. This will be followed by a live demo on how to create a local Git repository in RStudio and how to clone a remote GitHub repository.
